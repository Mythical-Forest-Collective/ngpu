# NGPU
NGPU attempts to be a fairly simple binding to [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native) so it can be used within Nim!

The reason why we're making a binding to WGPU is due to the simplicity and versatility it has! And as Nim is an already simple language, simple graphics should be included!
